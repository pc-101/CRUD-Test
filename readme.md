# Basic PHP & MySQL Form Integration

This is just a very basic integration of PHP + MySQL in the backend, with a simple Twitter Bootstrap 4 frontend to render a form. User would input their form info, and the backend will check to see if all fields have been filled in & sanitizes the string. Success message shows iff the entry is added to the DB.
